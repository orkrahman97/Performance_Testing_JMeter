## Load Testing

**I was tasked with performance testing the Bangla Puzzle website as part of my internship. I used JMeter to simulate 100-200 users accessing the website at the same time. The results showed that the website was able to handle the load without any significant performance degradation. The average response time was 2.3 seconds, and for 500 people the maximum response time was 5.5 seconds. These results are well within the acceptable range and indicate that the website is capable of handling a decent number of concurrent users.**

We achieved a 99% accuracy rate by reducing the workload and increasing User 100.

when we increased the number of users to 150, we encountered a 5% error rate. Therefore, we can consider this value as the ideal one. If we increase the user the accuracy will reduce
